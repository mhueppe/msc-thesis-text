  abstract  = {The problem of protein structure determination is usually solved by X-ray crystallography. Several in silico deep learning methods have been developed to overcome the high attrition rate, cost of experiments and extensive trial-and-error settings, for predicting the crystallization propensities of proteins based on their sequences. In this work, we benchmark the power of open protein language models (PLMs) through the TRILL platform, a be-spoke framework democratizing the usage of PLMs for the task of predicting crystallization propensities of proteins. By comparing LightGBM / XGBoost classifiers built on the average embedding representations of proteins learned by different PLMs, such as ESM2, Ankh, ProtT5-XL, ProstT5, xTrimoPGLM, SaProt with the performance of state-of-the-art sequence-based methods like DeepCrystal, ATTCrys and CLPred, we identify the most effective methods for predicting crystallization outcomes. The LightGBM classifiers utilizing embeddings from ESM2 model with 30 and 36 transformer layers and 150 and 3000 million parameters respectively have performance gains by 3-\$\$5{\textbackslash}\%\$\$than all compared models for various evaluation metrics, including AUPR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve), AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve), and F1 on independent test sets. Furthermore, we fine-tune the ProtGPT2 model available via TRILL to generate crystallizable proteins. Starting with 3000 generated proteins and through a step of filtration processes including consensus of all open PLM-based classifiers, sequence identity through CD-HIT, secondary structure compatibility, aggregation screening, homology search and foldability evaluation, we identified a set of 5 novel proteins as potentially crystallizable.},

  abstract  = {Protein crystallization plays a fundamental role in structural biology and chemistry, drug discovery, and crystallography itself. Determining how to improve the crystal growth is necessary and vital during the whole process. According to the recently published data, crystallizing proteins on nanoporous surfaces (i.e., metal–organic framework, abbreviated as MOF) is faster and demands less protein. However, dispersing micro-sized MOF materials uniformly is still a challenge and limiting process in protein crystallization. Here, we investigate the uniformity of micro-sized MOF under the treatment of the high-pressure homogenizer. At various pressures, the MOF is split into particles of different sizes, including the uniform and stable nano-sized MOF. Crystallization experiments demonstrated its enhancement in protein crystallization, and the number of crystals is significantly increased in the presence of nano-sized MOF. This work explores the use of nano-sized MOF solids to crystallize proteins of limited availability (i.e., insufficient for conventional methods) or of a hard-to-crystallize nature.},

This paper reviews their relevance for and impact on protein crystallography., Deep learning techniques can recognize complex patterns in noisy, multidimensional data. In recent years, researchers have started to explore the potential of deep learning in the field of structural biology, including protein crystallography. This field has some significant challenges, in particular producing high-quality and well ordered protein crystals. Additionally, collecting diffraction data with high completeness and quality, and determining and refining protein structures can be problematic. Protein crystallographic data are often high-dimensional, noisy and incomplete. Deep learning algorithms can extract relevant features from these data and learn to recognize patterns, which can improve the success rate of crystallization and the quality of crystal structures.

  abstract = {Using an extended set of protein features calculated separately for protein surface and interior, a new version of XtalPred based on a random forest classifier achieves a significant improvement in predicting the success of structure determination from the primary amino-acid sequence., Obtaining diffraction quality crystals remains one of the major bottlenecks in structural biology. The ability to predict the chances of crystallization from the amino-acid sequence of the protein can, at least partly, address this problem by allowing a crystallographer to select homologs that are more likely to succeed and/or to modify the sequence of the target to avoid features that are detrimental to successful crystallization. In 2007, the now widely used XtalPred algorithm [Slabinski et al. (2007), Protein Sci. 16, 2472–2482] was developed. XtalPred classifies proteins into five ‘crystallization classes’ based on a simple statistical analysis of the physicochemical features of a protein. Here, towards the same goal, advanced machine-learning methods are applied and, in addition, the predictive potential of additional protein features such as predicted surface ruggedness, hydrophobicity, side-chain entropy of surface residues and amino-acid composition of the predicted protein surface are tested. The new XtalPred-RF (random forest) achieves significant improvement of the prediction of crystallization success over the original XtalPred. To illustrate this, XtalPred-RF was tested by revisiting target selection from 271 Pfam families targeted by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG) in PSI-2, and it was estimated that the number of targets entered into the protein-production and crystallization pipeline could have been reduced by 30\% without lowering the number of families for which the first structures were solved. The prediction improvement depends on the subset of targets used as a testing set and reaches 100\% (i.e. twofold) for the top class of predicted targets.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel method for selecting parameters of finite fields formed by 2 × 2 matrices over a finite field of integers modulo a prime p. The method aims to simultaneously determine both the field parameters and primitive elements, thereby optimizing the construction of cryptographic algorithms. The proposed approach leverages the properties of quadratic residues and non-residues, simplifying the process of finding matrix field parameters while maintaining computational efficiency. The method is particularly effective when the prime number p is either a Mersenne prime or (p + 1)/2 is also a prime. This study demonstrates that the resulting matrix fields can be practically computed, offering a high degree of flexibility for cryptographic protocols such as key agreement and secure data transmission. Compared to previous methods, the new method reduces the parameter search space and provides a structured way to identify primitive elements without the need for a separate search procedure. The findings have significant implications for the development of efficient cryptographic systems using matrix-based finite fields.},

  abstract = {The gateway to X-ray crystallography is the growth of macromolecular crystals. An attempt is made here to acquaint investigators with the principles and practice of protein crystallization, some recent innovations, and to touch upon some of the remaining problems., Protein crystallization was discovered by chance about 150 years ago and was developed in the late 19th century as a powerful purification tool and as a demonstration of chemical purity. The crystallization of proteins, nucleic acids and large biological complexes, such as viruses, depends on the creation of a solution that is supersaturated in the macromolecule but exhibits conditions that do not significantly perturb its natural state. Supersaturation is produced through the addition of mild precipitating agents such as neutral salts or polymers, and by the manipulation of various parameters that include temperature, ionic strength and pH. Also important in the crystallization process are factors that can affect the structural state of the macromolecule, such as metal ions, inhibitors, cofactors or other conventional small molecules. A variety of approaches have been developed that combine the spectrum of factors that effect and promote crystallization, and among the most widely used are vapor diffusion, dialysis, batch and liquid–liquid diffusion. Successes in macromolecular crystallization have multiplied rapidly in recent years owing to the advent of practical, easy-to-use screening kits and the application of laboratory robotics. A brief review will be given here of the most popular methods, some guiding principles and an overview of current technologies.},

  abstract   = {X-ray diffraction technique is one of the most common methods of ascertaining protein structures, yet only 2–10\% of proteins can produce diffraction-quality crystals. Several computational methods have been proposed so far to predict protein crystallization. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art computational methods are limited by the scarcity of experimental data. Thus, the prediction accuracy of existing models hasn’t reached the ideal level. To address the problems above, we propose a novel transfer-learning-based framework for protein crystallization prediction, named TLCrys. The framework proceeds in two steps: pre-training and fine-tuning. The pre-training step adopts attention mechanism to extract both global and local information of the protein sequences. The representation learned from the pre-training step is regarded as knowledge to be transferred and fine-tuned to enhance the performance of crystalization prediction. During pre-training, TLCrys adopts a multi-task learning method, which not only improves the learning ability of protein encoding, but also enhances the robustness and generalization of protein representation. The multi-head self-attention layer guarantees that different levels of the protein representation can be extracted by the fine-tuned step. During transfer learning, the fine-tuning strategy used by TLCrys improves the task-specialized learning ability of the network. Our method outperforms all previous predictors significantly in five crystallization stages of prediction. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be well generalized to other protein sequence classification tasks.},

  abstract  = {Proteins’ biological functions are defined by the geometric and chemical structure of their 3D molecular surfaces. Recent works have shown that geometric deep learning can be used on mesh-based representations of proteins to identify potential functional sites, such as binding targets for potential drugs. Unfortunately though, the use of meshes as the underlying representation for protein structure has multiple drawbacks including the need to pre-compute the input features and mesh connectivities. This becomes a bottleneck for many important tasks in protein science. In this paper, we present a new framework for deep learning on protein structures that addresses these limitations. Among the key advantages of our method are the computation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the underlying atomic point cloud and a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. As a result, we are able to process large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fashion, taking as the sole input the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of their atoms, eliminating the need for any hand-crafted pre-computed features. To showcase the performance of our approach, we test it on two tasks in the field of protein structural bioinformatics: the identification of interaction sites and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. On both tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with much faster run times and fewer parameters than previous models. These results will considerably ease the deployment of deep learning methods in protein science and open the door for end-to-end differentiable approaches in protein modeling tasks such as function prediction and design.},

  abstract  = {In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

  abstract = {Protein crystallization remains a major bottleneck in X‐ray crystallography due to difficulties in achieving favorable molecular arrangements within the crystal lattice. While protein–protein interactions at molecular packing interfaces are crucial for determining crystallization conditions, methods for predicting crystal packing interfaces and systematically exploring crystallization conditions remain limited. In this study, we present MASCL (Molecular Assembly Simulation in Crystal Lattice), a novel approach that integrates AlphaFold with symmetrical docking to simulate crystal packing. To evaluate packing quality, we introduced PackQ, a stringent metric based on the DockQ framework, where models with scores above 0.36 are considered successful. In benchmark tests on P41212 and P43212 space groups, MASCL successfully predicted packing interfaces for 26.8\% and 30.1\% of targets within the top 100 models. When focusing on models with successfully predicted initial crystallographic dimeric assemblies (DockQ ≥ 0.23), success rates improved to 57.9\% and 39.8\% within the top 25 models, respectively. Additionally, we developed AAI‐PatchBag, a patch‐based method using physicochemical descriptors to assess molecular interface similarity. Compared to conventional condition‐searching strategies like sequence alignment, structure superposition, and shape comparison, AAI‐PatchBag reduced the number of trials required to identify potential crystallization conditions. Applied to lysozyme crystallization, AAI‐PatchBag efficiently identified conditions yielding crystals with the desired packing. Overall, MASCL and AAI‐PatchBag advance the prediction of protein–protein interactions within the crystal lattice and facilitate the identification of potential crystallization conditions through molecular packing interface similarity, contributing to a deeper understanding of protein crystallization.},

The results suggest that chiral interactions with chiral additives are important in protein crystal formation., Chiral control of crystallization has ample precedent in the small-molecule world, but relatively little is known about the role of chirality in protein crystallization. In this study, lysozyme was crystallized in the presence of the chiral additive 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) separately using the R and S enantiomers as well as with a racemic RS mixture. Crystals grown with (R)-MPD had the most order and produced the highest resolution protein structures. This result is consistent with the observation that in the crystals grown with (R)-MPD and (RS)-MPD the crystal contacts are made by (R)-MPD, demonstrating that there is preferential interaction between lysozyme and this enantiomer. These findings suggest that chiral interactions are important in protein crystallization.},

Phase diagrams representing S as functions of NaCl content and temperature were obtained for two crystal forms of lysozyme. From the Arrhenius plot, the enthalpy of crystallization for the tetragonal form was calculated to be − 72 kJ/mol, and that for the orthorhombic form to be −32 kJ/mol. Conditions necessary for obtaining accurate phase diagrams were discussed, together with their possible use for crystal growth and for future molecular engineering.},

Crystallization phase diagrams at pH 2.5, 6.0 and 7.5 were determined. At pH {\textless} 4.5 the border between the metastable region and the nucleation region shifted to the left (lower precipitant concentration) in the phase diagram, and at pH {\textgreater} 4.5 the border shifted to the right (higher precipitant concentration). The qualities of these crystals were characterized using the Wilson plot method. The qualities of all crystals at different pH were more or less equivalent (B-factor values within 25–40). It is expected that neutron diffraction analysis of these crystals of different pH provides equivalent data in quality for discussions of protein pH titration in the crystalline state of hen egg-white lysozyme.},

This paper discusses a membrane-based micro-volume dialysis method suitable for rapid and high-throughput protein crystallization. A droplet of protein solution was deposited on the membrane surface in a micro-volume dialysis device. Crystallizing agents could be added to the protein solution either directly or through the membrane. The crystallization process could easily be monitored in real time under a microscope. Tiny specks, indicative of forming crystals, were observed as early as 30 s from the start of the experiment, and these were clearly distinguishable as tetragonal lysozyme crystals within 2 min. This method is particularly suitable for carrying out screening and optimization experiments, and for studying crystallization kinetics. The easy and direct manner in which protein and crystallizing agents are introduced into the device makes this method amenable to miniaturization and automation. Additionally, this approach would potentially allow for rapid screening of the effects of drug molecules on the crystallization process and the nature of crystal formation.},

The accuracies of these predictions vary, however, and they do not take into account ligands, covalent modifications or other environmental factors. Here, we evaluate how well AlphaFold predictions can be expected to describe the structure of a protein by comparing predictions directly with experimental crystallographic maps. In many cases, AlphaFold predictions matched experimental maps remarkably closely. In other cases, even very high-confidence predictions differed from experimental maps on a global scale through distortion and domain orientation, and on a local scale in backbone and side-chain conformation. We suggest considering AlphaFold predictions as exceptionally useful hypotheses. We further suggest that it is important to consider the confidence in prediction when interpreting AlphaFold predictions and to carry out experimental structure determination to verify structural details, particularly those that involve interactions not included in the prediction.},

Previous work has assumed that sequence similarity may provide useful information about appropriate crystallization cocktails; however, the authors are not aware of any quantitative verification of this assumption. This research investigates whether, given current information, one can detect any correlation between sequence similarity and crystallization cocktails. BLAST was used to quantitate the similarity between protein sequences in the Protein Data Bank, and this was compared with three estimations of the chemical similarities of the respective crystallization cocktails. No correlation was detected between proteins of similar (but not identical) sequence and their crystallization cocktails, suggesting that methods of determining screens based on this assumption are unlikely to result in screens that are better than those currently in use.},

Further analyses include which commercial kits are the most appropriate for shotgun or more traditional approaches to crystallization screening.

Funding of high throughput crystallography pilot projects through the NIH Protein Structure Initiative provides the opportunity to collect crystallization data in a comprehensive and statistically valid form. Data mining and machine learning algorithms thus have the potential to deliver predictive models for protein crystallization. However, the underlying complex physical reality of crystallization, combined with a generally ill-defined and sparsely populated sampling space, and inconsistent scoring and annotation make the development of predictive models non-trivial. We discuss the conceptual problems, and review strengths and limitations of current approaches towards crystallization prediction, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive and valid sampling protocols. In view of limited overlap in techniques and sampling parameters between the publicly funded high throughput crystallography initiatives, exchange of information and standardization should be encouraged, aiming to effectively integrate data mining and machine learning efforts into a comprehensive predictive framework for protein crystallization. Similar experimental design and knowledge discovery strategies should be applied to valid analysis and prediction of protein expression, solubilization, and purification, as well as crystal handling and cryo-protection.},

  abstract   = {Protein crystallization is a major bottleneck in protein X-ray crystallography, the workhorse of most structural proteomics projects. Because the principles that govern protein crystallization are too poorly understood to allow them to be used in a strongly predictive sense, the most common crystallization strategy entails screening a wide variety of solution conditions to identify the small subset that will support crystal nucleation and growth. We tested the hypothesis that more efficient crystallization strategies could be formulated by extracting useful patterns and correlations from the large data sets of crystallization trials created in structural proteomics projects. A database of crystallization conditions was constructed for 755 different proteins purified and crystallized under uniform conditions. Forty-five percent of the proteins formed crystals. Data mining identified the conditions that crystallize the most proteins, revealed that many conditions are highly correlated in their behavior, and showed that the crystallization success rate is markedly dependent on the organism from which proteins derive. Of the proteins that crystallized in a 48-condition experiment, 60\% could be crystallized in as few as 6 conditions and 94\% in 24 conditions. Consideration of the full range of information coming from crystal screening trials allows one to design screens that are maximally productive while consuming minimal resources, and also suggests further useful conditions for extending existing screens.

  abstract = {A database application has been developed for the collection of crystallographic information. This database (the BDP) has been populated with the information found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The tool has been used to store crystallization data parsed out of the PDB and these data may be used to extend the crystallization information found in the Biological Macromolecule Crystallization Database (BMCD) and could be used to refine crystallization methodology. A standard is proposed for describing a crystallization experiment that will ease future crystallization data collations and analyses.},
