\section{Feature Engineering}\label{methods/feature_engineering}
To enable the model to capture the complex relationships between proteins and crystallization conditions, multiple types of feature representations were constructed. These include sequence-based embeddings generated with established protein language models, a geometric surface representation derived using a fast sampling framework, and a contrastive language embedding of the crystallization labels themselves. Together, these complementary feature types provide information from protein sequence, structure, and condition descriptors.

In the following sections, I introduce each of these feature representations and describe how they were generated and integrated into the overall modeling pipeline.
